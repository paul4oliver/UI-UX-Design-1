<h3>In this project, I demonstrate my ability to analyze user interface/user experience design fundamentals
and develop user interface/user experience for mobile and touch-based systems based on the following user story:</h3>

<i>As a grower, I want to view a dashboard that informs me of the moisture content and nitrogen level in the soil at each of my trees so that I can easily target water use and track nitrogen levels.</i>

<h3>To complete the project I performed the following:</h3>

<b>One</b><br>
Explained the purpose and goals of the project.<br>
Analyzed the usability and user experience of a similar app.<br>

<b>Two</b><br>
Determined appropriate topics to discuss in interviews.<br>
Conducted interviews to collect relevant user information.<br>
Analyzed the information gathered from interviews.<br>
Explained who the target audience is for the mobile app design.<br>
Developed two user personas that illustrate the goals and approaches of the appâ€™s potential users.<br>
Applied personalized elements to the user personas.<br>

<b>Three</b><br>
Created a paper prototype that addresses the goals of the mobile app.<br>
Described the purpose and features of each screen.<br>
Conducted follow-up interviews that encouraged interaction with the paper prototype.<br>
Explained the updates made to prototype as a result of the interviews.<br>

<b>Four</b><br>
Developed a layout of different screens for the digital wireframe that addressed the goals of the project.<br>
Created navigational elements and value-added features in the wireframe.<br>
Applied design best practices to the digital wireframe.<br>
Explained the rationale behind design decisions.<br>
Discussed how the wireframe could be adapted to a digital watch.<br>
Discussed how the wireframe could be adapted to a touch-based kiosk.<br>
